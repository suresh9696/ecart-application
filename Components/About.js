        <p>Ekart not only works towards creating a cost efficient and optimised Supply Chain but also has a clear agenda on creating a Sustainable Supply Chain. We drive this charter through internal processes and by partnering with global organisations like Climate Group where we partner with the 100EV initiative and target to completely transition to Electric Vehicles by 2030 and with Canopy for Pack4Good Policy to conserve and protect endangered species and ancient forests. Over the last year Ekart has successfully reduced carbon emission by 12,000 MT through various internal initiatives across levers in the supply chain</p>
